So you're into calisthenics, maybe you're a beginner just starting to workout for the first time, maybe you're a seasoned calisthenics athlete, maybe you've made the switch from some other strength sports to calisthenics! Either way, these are some of the top YouTube channels to check out! Learn how to become stronger than ever before, discover progressions to unlock those calisthenics skills and get motivated for training! (Or if you need some content to binge watch these are my recommendations!)

## Fitness FAQs

My first recommendation is one of my favourite channels that I couldn't recommend enough. The channel is run by physiotherapist Daniel Vadanal with more than 10 years of training experience. He has a no nonsense attitude to his videos, always getting straight to the point. This means you'll always leave a FitnessFAQs video having learnt something new (or at the very least solidifying what you already know).

Bonus: There's a series of videos called FitnessFAQs World where Daniel collaborates with other big names in calisthenics and the fitness community. The videos are a lot longer than his usual ones, but they provide really interesting insight and you can discover new people to look into.

## Calisthenics Movement

This is again one of the biggest calisthenics youtube channels around. They've made hundreds of videos from detailing the best and worse exercises to incorporate into your workout program to how to attain skills such as the muscle up.

I found this channel an excellent source of information from progressions to learning the correct form cues. It's a great channel to just keep watching every so often as it'll just enrich your overall knowledge of calisthenics, and as you progress you'll have built a good foundations of ideas to then implement in your own training.

Not much more I can say again other than go and watch their videos!

## Tom Merrick

I found Tom's channel a little later on than the others. When you start off doing calisthenics you're all about going for those skills like the muscle up, front lever, and planche. However, once you start getting into it you realise there's a lot more to calisthenics. You find there's other aspects to focus on such as flexibility and mobility. This leads you onto finding other skills that aren't necessarily strength based such as handstands and L-sits (which, with sufficient training, can become V-sits). Tom's channel is a great place to start if you're just a bit curious or definitely interested in these things and he has a bunch of workout routines for all stages!

## Tao Physique

I don't remember how I found this channel, but I always find the videos fun to watch. The channel is run by Onatome Tasker and he's got a really laid back attitude to his videos. His approach to teaching you something is less formal than say the first two channels on this list. He's just a cool guy with experience that wants to share what he knows - that's the kind of vibe I get from his videos. I very much enjoy how real he is for example not hiding the fact that working out makes you more attractive (you'll get what you mean when you've watched a few of his videos). And, yes, not everyone works out to attract people they're interested in, but I don't think anyone can deny it's not a satisfying byproduct.

Another cool thing about his channel is he talks about topics outside just doing calisthenics too. He talks about the downsides of being super lean, there's also videos about diet topics such as bulking, lean bulking and intermittent fasting. There's definitely a roundedness to the channel in that respect, a good mix of fitness related stuff but also nutrition too which plays a massive part in our progress.
