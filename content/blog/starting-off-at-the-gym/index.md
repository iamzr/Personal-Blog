## Why did i write this routine?

Following on from my post about why I think everyone should go to the gym, I realised what if you want to go but you don't know what to do? I remember when I started uni I had a goal of wanting to go to the gym, but had no idea where to start or what exercises to do. I tried some workout routines I found online but didn't know to make progress with them and they just didn't stick. It's only when a friend of mine encouraged me to go and showed me how to do things did I really make a start, and which lead to where I am today!

## Who's this for?

This is a beginner gym routine, if you:

- Have never been to the gym
- Started going to the gym, but not really sure what to do
- Started going to the gym, but have just been running random online routines without telling you how to make progress

If you have a routine already, check out this one! You might learn something or want to switch over.

If you're more experienced in the gym, or just interested, have a look anyway! Leave a comment about what you think.

## The Routine
