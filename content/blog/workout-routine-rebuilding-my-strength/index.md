## Context

The combination of lockdown and my masters meant I had to take a significant amount of time - around 6 months - away from going to the gym and training calisthenics.

To get back into it I created a routine with the main goal of building back up my base level of strength, as well as to get me back into the routine of going to the gym. The main issue I found was I was still able to perform all the exercises I could before, however, to a substantially lower number of reps. Before focusing on improving my more advanced exercises, in this routine I simply focus on solidifying my basic exercises and movement patterns.

This routine is based off the [Recommended Routine from r/bodyweightness](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine/), however it's been slightly adapted to my liking and goals.

## Goals

Before you can create a workout routine, it's first important to set goals for what you want to achieve the following are mine for the duration of this training block (of 4-6 weeks).

- Pullups - 3x10 pullups, ideally aiming for C2B pullups if possible
- Squat - 3x10 bodyweight (75kg) barbell squat
- Dips - 3x10 ring dips (with RTO at the top), then aiming for 3x5 Bulgarian ring dips
- Deadlift - 3x5 bodyweight (75kg) conventional deadlift
- Pushups - 3x20 archer pushups (10 on each side)
- Rows - 3x20 archer rows (10 on each side)

You might notice my squat and deadlift goals sound fairly conservative. This is because I've never actually squatted or deadlifted before. I can do pistol squats and single legged deadlifts with ease, so I feel like those are reasonable goals to achieve within a month. My focus for those two exercises is to just start off very light, really understand the movement and then gradually build up the weight and see how it goes. I plan on following a linear progression with the weights, which simply means I'm going to add a little bit of weight each session.

## Routine

This is a full body routine that I ran every other day, so 3-4 times a week. With the aim to run it approximately 4-6 weeks. The program is mostly based around pairing up exercises AKA supersets i.e. you do one set of one exercise then without rest you do another set of another exercise, and that counts as one superset. The main reason I chose to do this is because it saves time as well as keeping the intensity of the workout high - plus I just like it.

TL;DR After the warmup, the workout has three main supersets, followed by core work and then I end with some lateral raises (because who doesn't want to look good?)

### Warmup

A warm up is key to making sure to get the most out of you're workout, so if you're not doing one you should start now! This warm up is a general one and cover all the major muscles that will be used in this workout.

For the dynamic exercises i usually do around 10 reps or more if I feel like to get warmed up. For static exercises, I would usually do around a 60s hold. I believe the best approach to warming up is listen to how your body feels and what it's telling you. If you're feeling a bit stiff somewhere focus a little more on that muscle, make sure your body is fully ready and in the optimum state to begin working out.

#### 7. Squat Warmup

I usually do a set of 10 with the bar, which is in addition to my warmup sets which I'll do a little later.

#### 8. Deadlift Warmup

Again, I start off with a set of 10 with a very light weight on the bar, and will do additional warmup sets before my working sets, later on.

## Workout

To prevent lots of repetition, for the following exercises, I aim to do 3 sets of 5-10 reps (i.e 3x5-10). I perform each exercise in a pair back to back with no rest in between. Being realistic there will be a short gap in trying to set up from going from pullups say to a squat(see first pair below), however I try to minimise this as much as possible. I take a 60s rest in between a set of each pair (i.e. 1 set of pullups, 1 set of squats, followed by a 60s rest, then it's onto the second set of pullups and so on). I usually take a 90s rest after I've completed all the sets for each pair.

Before I start the the first and second pair, I'll do warm up sets for my squat and deadlift. I usually start with say 40kg (i.e 20kg bar with 10kg plates on either side), then work up in increments of ~20kg until I'm at my working weight. I'll however save my first set of my working weight for when I start doing the squats with pullups. Say I my working weight is 80kg, I'll do 1x5 of 40kg, 1x5 of 60kg, and then I'll start doing the paired exercise, one set of pullups followed by 1x5 of 80kg , rest, then a set of pullups, and the next set of 80kg squats, and so on.

For the core work, I usually do a max hold for each plank variation listed with a 30s rest in between, and once I've completed all three I'll take a 60s rest. I repeat this three times, which means 3 sets for each type of plank.

In other words: 40s front plank, 30s rest, 40s left side plank, 30s rest, 40s right side plank, 60s rest, repeat two more times.

### First Pair

- Pullups
- Squats

### Second Pair

- Ring dips
- Deadlift

### Third Pair

- Archer rows
- Archer pushups

### Core Works

- Front plank
- Left side plank
- Right side plank

### For them big shoulders

To finish off my workout, I throw in 2 sets of dumbbell lateral raises just for aesthetics. I usually do them as drop sets, I'll start off with 8kg do as many as i can then drop to say 5kg and do as many as I can.

- Lateral raises
